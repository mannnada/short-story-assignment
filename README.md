## About the Paper

**Title:** FlowDubber: Movie Dubbing with LLM-based Semantic-aware Learning and Flow Matching based Voice Enhancing  
**Published:** April 2025 on arXiv  
**Authors:** Gaoxiang Cong, Liang Li, Jiadong Pan, Zhedong Zhang, Amin Beheshti, Anton van den Hengel, Yuankai Qi, Qingming Huang  

### Objective
The paper introduces a novel dubbing framework, FlowDubber, designed to improve the quality of dubbed video content by solving three core challenges:
1. Precise lip-syncing between audio and video.
2. Accurate cloning of speaker identity across languages.
3. Preservation of emotional tone and acoustic quality.

### Core Components
- **LLM-based Semantic-aware Learning (LLM-SL):** Uses Qwen2.5 to understand context from movie scripts and reference audio, enabling expressive and content-aware dubbing.
- **Dual Contrastive Aligning (DCA):** Aligns phoneme-level information from speech with lip movements using bidirectional contrastive loss.
- **Flow-based Voice Enhancing (FVE):** Applies acoustic flow matching with style transformation to improve the naturalness and clarity of generated audio.

### Experiments
FlowDubber is evaluated on two datasets:
- **Chem:** Real-world educational video dataset.
- **GRID:** Studio-recorded benchmark with multiple speakers.

Metrics used include:
- **LSE-C / LSE-D:** Lip-sync accuracy
- **SIM-O:** Speaker similarity
- **WER:** Word error rate
- **UTMOS / DNSMOS:** Acoustic quality and noise suppression

The model outperforms baselines like StyleDubber, Speaker2Dubber, and ProDubber across all key metrics, including in zero-shot scenarios.
